### Images

Replace the images in the `public` folder with your own screenshots. Make sure to keep the naming convention:
- `feature_light.png` - Light mode version

## üì± Mobile App Integration

This landing page is designed to promote the TaleGarden mobile app. The download buttons can be configured to point to the App Store and Google Play Store once the app is published.

## üîÑ Theme Switching

The theme switching is implemented using a context provider that persists the user's preference in local storage. The theme switch component is accessible from any page of the application.
